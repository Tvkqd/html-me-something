                   <p>
                       "Lunar New Year (Te&#770&#769t) is the biggest festival of Vietnam. Usually it happens around end of January
                       or in February, depending on the Lunar Calendar(Calendar used in some Asian countries based on the Moon).
                       I do not have to come to school for over 2 weeks. My sisters will have a whole week off. 
                       People living away from home will all coming back. 
                       Traditional flowers (apricot blossom and peach blossom) are in front of every house's doors, gardens, markets, and on the road.
                       For a week, we will shopping, decorate, celebrate, party, gather, and talk about what happened, what's new.
                       I love Tet(another name of this festival) not only because I can meet all people in family but also I can earn some cash.
                       Older people will give younger people some "lucky money" in a red paper bag after recieving a best wish. However, my sisters are having
                       babies and I will be old soon."

                   <p>
                       "This is my second favorite festival. It happens around September based on the Lunar Calendar.
                       I receive mooncake from school and my church. There will be small music show, which recall the festival history at my church.
                       Sometime, I got invited to perform dancing in the show. After the show, when the round moon appear brightly
                       on the night sky, we parade with colorful lantern on our hand. I alway made my own lantern with my brother.
                       When I am away from home during the festival, I usually took a moment to look back all the good time that I had."

                   <h4>"God of Kitchen" Festival</h4>
                   <p>
                       "The "God of Kitchen" is a one who knows every nook and cranny of a place.
                       On the 23rd of December (Lunar Calendar), families throughout Vietnam maintain the habit of 
                       preparing a farewell ceremony to see The God of Kitchen to the heaven. My mother and I usually prepared
                       the fish for that day. We went to the pagoda together. Later at that night, we will have a small party
                       and recall the legend of Kitchen God. Also, we watch the Kitchen God comedy show at mid-night.
                       The only thing that I like doing on this festival was going to the pagoda. It's located very high on the mountain.
                       It's very crowded, but that is fun to hike with a lot of people.
